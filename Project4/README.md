## Written by Philip Hoel, Theo G. Halvorsen and Elakkyen Pathmanathan

This is the code for simulation of phase transition through the ising model

Code:

    - C++
    
    - Python

Packages:

    - armadillo
    - mpi
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - pandas

Classes:

    isingmodel - All methods regarding the ising model

Python scrips:

    run.py - To run different assignments
    read_c.py - Problem c
    read_d.py - Problem d
    read_e.py - Problem e
    read_f.py - Problem f

Running program:

    To run program, use run.py

    Python3 run.py -problem -n -mcs

    -problem:
        c
