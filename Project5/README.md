# Project 5 - Diffusion Equation

## Written by Philip Hoel, Theo G. Halvorsen and Elakkyen Pathmanathan

This is the code for testing different numerical algorithm for solving PDEs

Code:

    - C++
    
    - Python

Packages:

    - armadillo
    - argparse
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - pandas

Classes:

    Solver - Class for 1D problem
    Solver2dim - Class for 2D problem

Python scrips:

    run.py - Control program for running all other programs
    read1D.py - To plot 1D problem
    readError.py - To plot error differences
    read2D.py - To plot 2D problem

Running program:

    python3 run.py Problem Default

    Problem:
        1 - 1D contour plot
        2 - 1D Error
        3 - 2D contour plot
        4  Runtime

    Default:
        True - Runs default values
        False - Asks for different values
